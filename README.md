# cat-service

I have created a backend application that uses the cat API and returns:

  - All breeds
  - One breed by id
  - All public images
  - An image by id 

I have used Spring Boot and Java programming language to create the application

This backend application can be used by any frontend application that consumes JSON data. 

Screenshot of the json data for all breeds:
